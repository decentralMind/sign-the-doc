# sign-the-doc

Deploy Hash of the document/file on Ethereum blockchain and let anyone or only authorized signers(address) to sign the hash of the document thus completing document signature process.

Project live at: https://decentralmind.github.io/signthedoc

## update:-
From now on only solidity files and it's helper javascript files will be updated. Please avoid the Reactjs code, it's complicated
and horrible as I was just experimenting with Reactjs. I want to solely focus on solidity now. May be in future I'll learn Vue.js and design the simple front UI which is not overly complicated like this one. However Solidity code is fine and will be updated on regular basis. I'll soon deploy it on Main Ethereum Network.

## INSTALLATION GUIDE

### 1.Clone this repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/decentralMind/sign-the-doc
```

### 2.Install Packages.
Go inside project directory where package.json is included and install the packages.

```sh
cd sign-the-doc/client
npm install
```

### 3.Install few Packages globally.
```sh
npm install -g @truffle/hdwallet-provider
npm install -g chai
npm install -g chai-bn
npm install -g semver
npm install -g dotenv
```

### 4.Install or Log-in to MetaMask.
- MetaMask(https://metamask.io/)
- Official Installation tutorial video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8)

### 5.Install and configure Ganache.
Ganache is a  personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

There are two versions available(Desktop and Command line version).

You can choose one of the version below.

- Desktop version:-
  - Download and install [Desktop version](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).
  - Open Ganache desktop client.
  - Click setting icon at the top right corner.
  - Click Sever and choose port: 8545.
  - Click ACCOUNTS & KEYS.
  - Enter the same 12 word seed phrase used on MetaMask.
- Command Line Version:-
  - Download and install [Command Line version](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).
  - Run follow command with same 12 word seed phrase used on MetaMask.
  ```sh
  ganache-cli -m "same 12 word seed phrase used on Metamask"
  ```

### 6.Configure Infura.
This step is not necessary if you are deploying at local Ganache client, jump to step 9 below for local deployment.

However if you are planning to deploy to live tesnet without downloading whole chain and running your own node,  use Infura.

_Infura Setup instruction:-_

(This instruction is for https://infura.io/).
- Register and Setup INFURA [HERE](https://infura.io/).
- Click Create New Project after successful registration process.
- Name it SignTheDoc('or any name').
- Click VIEW PROJECT.
- Choose Ropsten from ENDPOINT Dropdown.
- Copy the ENDPOINT Link.

### 7.dotenv setup.
Skip this step for local Ganache deployment, jump to step 9.

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
(https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

- Create .env file on project root folder.
- Inside .env file create variable SEED12 without var/let/const and assign same 12 word seed phrase used on Metamask
example:
SEED12 = "Your 12 word seed from MetaMask".
- Inside .evv create variable name ROPSTEN(or any test network) without var/let/const and assign it with Infura ENDPOINT Link.(If you don't have a link follow above step 6.)
example:
ROPSTEN = "ROPSTEN infura endpoint"

### 8.Configure truffle.config.js
Skip this step for local Ganache deployment, jump to step 9.

I've commented out kovan and rinkeby network. However, you can initialize the kovan and rinkeby network following similar above step 7 procedure.

### 9.Compile and Deploy.
- **_Local Ganache deployment_**
```sh
cd sign-the-doc
truffle compile && truffle migrate
```
- **_Ropsten deployment_**
```sh
cd sign-the-doc
truffle compile && truffle migrate --network ropsten
```

### 10.Run test.
Go into root project directory and run test.

```sh
cd sign-the-doc

truffle test
```
If everything is alright, all test should pass.

### 11.Run the App.
Go into root project directory.

```sh
cd sign-the-doc
cd client
npm start
```

Visit [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) on your browser. App should be running.
